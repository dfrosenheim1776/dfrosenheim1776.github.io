    <p>Got a girl from the Southside, got braids in her hair
        <br>
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair</p>
        <br>
<pre>Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
            Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, 
she don't need no belt
But I can turn 'em inside out, I don't need no help

Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet (man)
Ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
            Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry

I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks with the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers

On a highway to heaven headed south of her smile, mm
Get there when we get there, every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

I know every curve like the back of my hand

            Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can
I'ma take it slow

Just as fast I can (body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed)
Got braids in her hair (I know every curve like the back of my hand)
